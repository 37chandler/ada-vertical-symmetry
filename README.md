# Numbers with Vertical Symmetry

In this exercise you'll find all numbers of a certain length 
with vertical symmetry. This means the numbers read the same 
when flipped top to bottom. For the purposes of this exercise
we'll assume that a "6" is an upside down "9" and that 0, 8, and 1
are all symmetrical vertically. 

Note that numbers with leading zero should not be counted. For instance,
"010" is not a valid vertically symmetrical number of length 3.

Update this readme with the answers to the following table:

| Number Length  | Number of Vertically Symmetrical Numbers  |
|---|---|
| 1  | ?  |
| 2  | ?  |
| 3  | ?  |
| 5  | ?  |
| 10 | ?  |

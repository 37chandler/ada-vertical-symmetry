# Numbers with Vertical Symmetry

In this exercise you'll find all numbers of a certain length 
with vertical symmetry. This means the numbers read the same 
when flipped top to bottom. For the purposes of this exercise
we'll assume that a "6" is an upside down "9" and that 0, 8, and 1
are all symmetrical vertically.
